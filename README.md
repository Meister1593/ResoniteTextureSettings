# Resonite Texture Settings

Allows users to control texture quality settings clientside. Useful for decreasing texture memory usage.

This mod takes full advantage of Resonite's asset variant system, offloading work to the asset servers.

## Features
- Locally limit the maximum resolution of loaded textures
- Option to ignore the "Uncompressed" flag when downloading static textures

~~- Cross-compatibile with Android/Quest!~~ (Resonite is not android compatible (yet))

~~- Fixes rainbow artifacting and various crashes on Android devices.~~

~~## Android/Quest Installation~~
~~- Make sure you've patched your application with NML support first! You can find the APK patching tool [here](https://github.com/Raemien/NeosAPKPatchingTool).~~
~~- Place `NeosTextureSettings.dll` into your `ModData/com.Solirax.Neos/nml_mods` folder using SideQuest.~~
